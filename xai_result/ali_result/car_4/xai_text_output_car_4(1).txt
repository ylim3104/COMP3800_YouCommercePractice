| Damaged Parts    | Type of Damage       | Estimated Repair Time | Estimated Cost (CAD) | Recommended Action |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Front Bumper     | Severe Deformation   | 4-6 hours             | $800-$1200          | Replace           |
| Hood             | Severe Deformation   | 6-8 hours             | $1000-$1500         | Replace           |
| Headlight        | Cracked/Broken       | 1-2 hours             | $200-$500           | Replace           |
| Fender           | Severe Deformation   | 4-6 hours             | $600-$1000          | Replace           |
| Grille           | Cracked/Broken       | 1-2 hours             | $150-$300           | Replace           |
| Radiator Support | Bent/Deformed        | 4-6 hours             | $500-$800           | Replace           |

### Analysis:
- **Front Bumper**: The bumper is severely deformed, suggesting a high-impact collision. Replacement is more cost-effective due to the extent of damage.
- **Hood**: The hood shows significant deformation, indicating it cannot be repaired effectively. Replacement is necessary.
- **Headlight**: The headlight is visibly broken, requiring replacement.
- **Fender**: The fender is also severely deformed, making replacement the best option.
- **Grille**: The grille is cracked and broken, which is typically replaced rather than repaired.
- **Radiator Support**: The deformation of the front end suggests the radiator support is bent, which would need to be replaced to ensure structural integrity.

The rear of the car is not visible in the image, so no assessment could be made regarding any potential damage there.
