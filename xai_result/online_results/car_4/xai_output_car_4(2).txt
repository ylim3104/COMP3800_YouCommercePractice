**Notes:**
- The image shows significant damage to the front of the car, but the severity of internal damage (e.g., to the radiator, engine components) cannot be assessed from the image alone.
- The estimates provided are based on typical repair times and costs for 2025 in Canada, considering the extent of visible damage.
- For parts like the radiator support, repair might be possible but replacement might be more cost-effective depending on the extent of internal damage not visible in the image.

**Errors:**
- `<error>Unable to assess internal engine components because not visible in the image</error>`
- `<error>Unable to assess rear of the car because not visible in the image</error>`
