**Explanation**:
- **Front Bumper**: The image clearly shows a significant dent on the front bumper. Repairing such a dent typically takes 2-4 hours and costs between $300-$600 CAD in 2025.
- **Hood**: There is a noticeable dent on the hood. Similar to the bumper, repairing this would take 2-4 hours and cost between $300-$600 CAD.

Since the image only shows the front bumper and part of the hood, other parts of the car cannot be assessed.
